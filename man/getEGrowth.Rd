\usage{
getEGrowth(object, n, n_pp, e_spawning, e)

\S4method{getEGrowth}{MizerParams,matrix,numeric,matrix,matrix}(object, n, n_pp,
  e_spawning, e)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \linkS4class{MizerParams} object.}

\item{n}{A matrix of species abundance (species x size).}

\item{n_pp}{A vector of the background abundance by size.}

\item{e_spawning}{The energy available for spawning (optional, although if
specified, e must also be specified). A matrix of size no. species x no.
size bins. If not supplied, is calculated internally using the
\code{\link{getESpawning}} method.}

\item{e}{The energy available for reproduction and growth (optional, although
if specified, e_spawning must also be specified). A matrix of size no.
species x no. size bins. If not supplied, is calculated internally using
the \code{\link{getEReproAndGrowth}} method.}
}
\value{
A two dimensional array (prey species x prey size)
}
\description{
Calculates the energy \eqn{g_i(w)} available by species and size for growth
after metabolism, movement and reproduction have been accounted for. Used by
the \code{\link{project}} method for performing simulations.
