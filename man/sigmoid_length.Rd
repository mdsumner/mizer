\title{Length based sigmoid selectivity function}
\usage{
sigmoid_length(w, l25, l50, a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{the size of the individual.}

\item{l25}{the length which gives a selectivity of 25\%.}

\item{l50}{the length which gives a selectivity of 50\%.}

\item{a}{the multiplier of the length-weight function.}

\item{b}{the exponent of the length-weight function.}
}
\description{
A sigmoid shaped selectivity function. Based on two parameters \code{l25} and
\code{l50} which determine the length at which 25\% and 50\% of the stock is
selected respectively. As the size-based model is weight based, and this
selectivity function is length based, it is also necessary to supply the
length-weight parameters \code{a} and \code{b}.
