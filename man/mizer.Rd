\title{mizer: Multi-species size-based modelling in R}
\description{
The mizer package implements multi-species size-based modelling in R. It has 
been designed for modelling marine ecosystems.
}
\details{
Using \pkg{mizer} is relatively simple.  There are three main stages: 
\enumerate{

\item Setting the model parameters. This is done by creating an object of 
class \code{MizerParams}. This includes model parameters such as the life 
history parameters of each species, and the range of the size spectrum.

\item Running a simulation. This is done by calling the \code{project()} 
method on the model parameters. This produces an object of \code{MizerSim} 
which contains the results of the simulation.

\item Exploring results. After a simulation has been run, the results can be 
explored using a range of plots and summaries. 
}

See the accompanying vignette for full details of the principles behind mizer
and how the package can be used to peform size-based modelling.
