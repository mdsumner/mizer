\usage{
project(object, effort, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{MizerParams} object}

\item{effort}{The effort of each fishing gear through time. See notes below.}

\item{t_max}{The maximum time the projection runs for. The default value is
100. However, this argument is not needed if an array is used for the
\code{effort} argument, in which case this argument is ignored. See notes
below.}

\item{dt}{Time step of the solver. The default value is 0.1.}

\item{t_save}{The frequency with which the output is stored. The default
value is 1.}

\item{initial_n}{The initial populations of the species. See the notes below.}

\item{initial_n_pp}{The initial population of the background spectrum. It
should be a numeric vector of the same length as the \code{w_full} slot of
the \code{MizerParams} argument. By default the \code{cc_pp} slot of the
\code{\link{MizerParams}} argument is used.}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{MizerSim}.
}
\description{
Runs the size-based model simulation and projects the size based model
through time. \code{project} is called using an object of type
\linkS4class{MizerParams} and an object that contains the effort of the
fishing gears through time. The method returns an object of type
\linkS4class{MizerSim} which can then be explored with a range of summary and
plotting methods.
}
\note{
The \code{effort} argument specifies the level of fishing effort during
the simulation. It can be specified in three different ways: \itemize{ \item
A single numeric value. This specifies the effort of all fishing gears which
is constant through time (i.e. all the gears have the same constant effort). 
\item A numerical vector which has the same length as the number of fishing
gears. The vector must be named and the names must correspond to the gear
names in the \code{MizerParams} object. The values in the vector specify the
constant fishing effort of each of the fishing gears, i.e. the effort is
constant through time but each gear may have a different fishing effort. 
\item A numerical array with dimensions time step x gear. This specifies the
fishing effort of each gear at each time step.  The first dimension, time,
must be named numerically and contiguously. The second dimension of the array
must be named and the names must correspond to the gear names in the
\code{MizerParams} argument. }

If effort is specified as an array then the \code{t_max} argument is ignored
and the maximum simulation time is the taken from the dimension names.

The \code{initial_n} argument is a matrix with dimensions species x size. The
order of species must be the same as in the \code{MizerParams} argument. If
the initial population is not specified, the argument is set by default by
the \code{get_initial_n} function which is set up for a North Sea model.
