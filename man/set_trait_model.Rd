\description{
This functions creates a \code{MizerParams} object so that trait-based-type 
models can be easily set up and run. The trait-based size spectrum model can
be derived as a simplification of the general size-based model used in
\code{mizer}. All the species-specific parameters are the same, except for
the asymptotic size, which is considered the most important trait
characterizing a species. Other parameters are related to the asymptotic
size. For example, the size at maturity is given by w_inf * eta, where eta is
the same for all species. For the trait-based model the number of species is
not important. For applications of the trait-based model see Andersen &
Pedersen (2010). See the \code{mizer} vignette for more details and examples
of the trait-based model.
}
\details{
The function has many arguments, all of which have default values. Of
particular interest to the user are the number of species in the model and
the minimum and maximum asymptotic sizes. The asymptotic sizes of the species
are spread evenly on a logarithmic scale within this range.

The stock recruitment relationship is the default Beverton-Holt style. The
maximum recruitment is calculated using equilibrium theory (see Andersen &
Pederson, 2010) and a multiplier, \code{k0}. Users should adjust \code{k0} to
get the spectra they want.

The factor for the search volume, \code{gamma}, is calculated using the
expected feeding level, \code{f0}.

Fishing selectivity is modelled as a knife-edge function with one parameter,
\code{knife_edge_size}, which is the size at which species are selected. Each
species can either be fished by the same gear (\code{knife_edge_size} has a
length of 1) or by a different gear (the length of \code{knife_edge_size} has
the same length as the number of species and the order of selectivity size is
that of the asymptotic size).

The resulting \code{MizerParams} object can be projected forward using
\code{project()} like any other \code{MizerParams} object. When projecting
the community model it may be necessary to reduce \code{dt} to 0.1 to avoid
any instabilities with the solver. You can check this by plotting the biomass
or abundance through time after the projection.
